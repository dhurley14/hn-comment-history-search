VYour point on evidence is dead on. This is an entirely anecdotal piece which is why I titled it "Programming Has Changed My Life" rather than "Programming Can Change Your Life Too".The latter claim requires a lot more research because it is a huge leap.Whether I would have developed critical thinking skills naturally can be up to debate. The argument for programming being the factor is because computers are black and white in the early days. Code works or code doesn't work. We don't always get that direct feedback in human interaction.\u000a

VAlthough perhaps politically impossible, I maintain that the only check against corruption and misuse of mass data collection is to make it freely available to the public.Mass surveillance is not going away. If anything, it will accelerate. The only way to keep the powerful from misusing it is to put everybody on the same level playing field.The alternative is to glue our crossed fingers together and hope that nobody will abuse a technology that can bring so much good to do many people.\u000a

V>I spent much of April and May increasingly grumpy and withdrawn and on edge. Weekends and evenings have become even less useful, instead being clogged by a sense of paralyzing dread that I\u2019m wasting fleeting time if I\u2019m not doing ten amazing things at once. I\u2019ve foregone trivial maintenance like cleaning junk off my desk because I don\u2019t feel like I have 20 minutes to spare. I stay up hours later than I mean to, not even doing anything, just trying to put off sleeping \u2014 because the next thing I experience will be waking up and going back to work.I'm sorry the author wasn't able to get things done while in the `dread`. I've got an alternative perspective.I like working on multiple stuff. I see the day job as one of the several projects I work on.I've worked on projects, squeezing my brain through the longest span it can, on one single project and also the exact opposite - juggling focus spans between a few projects, when one gets too vague.I'd say the latter worked best for me in terms of#1. Getting stuff done.#2. The satisfaction of being productive.Time management is the key.#1. Wake up early and start the day early. This would make your daytime extensive enough to accommodate several slots.#2. Remember Parkinson's law. Put extra concentration while on the day job, so that you can wrap up early. Don't do this with dread. Consider the job as working on one of several projects, with a larger team, than those of your other projects. This has helped me overcome the feeling of helplessness.#3. Side projects need not be hackathons. One meaningful commit, made everyday will take it a long way. Read http://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/. So stop worrying about not doing much on a specific day. On the contrast, worry if you haven't been consistent in committing code everyday.\u000a

VUrgh.> But I am a single mother who can\u2019t afford health insurance under Obamacare. The president\u2019s mortgage-loan modification program, \u201cHOPE NOW,\u201d didn\u2019t help me. Tuesday, I drove into Virginia from my hometown of Morgantown, W.Va., where I see rural America and ordinary Americans, like me, still struggling to make ends meet, after eight years of the Obama administration."So... I voted for a party whose battle cry since Obamacare has been to make sure no one can afford it, and whose policies are proven to do nothing for rural america - unlike the other side, whose policies are well intentioned but not as effective as I'd like."> Finally, as a liberal Muslim who has experienced, first-hand, Islamic extremism in this world, I have been opposed to the decision by President Obama and the Democratic Party to tap dance around the \u201cIslam\u201d in Islamic State. Of course, Trump\u2019s rhetoric has been far more than indelicate and folks can have policy differences with his recommendations, but, to me, it has been exaggerated and demonized by the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, their media channels, such as Al Jazeera, and their proxies in the West, in a convenient distraction from the issue that most worries me as a human being on this earth: extremist Islam of the kind that has spilled blood from the hallways of the Taj Mahal hotel in Mumbai to the dance floor of the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla."So I voted for the guy whose blundering about will do more to swell the ranks of Radical Islamic Terrorism, by removing the grey zone and therefore playing directly into ISIS's stated strategy, than any over-caution the other side may have been guilty of displaying."> By mid-October, it was one Aug. 17, 2014, email from the WikiLeaks treasure trove of Clinton emails that poisoned the well for me. In it, Clinton told aide John Podesta: \u201cWe need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL,\u201d the politically correct name for the Islamic State, \u201cand other radical Sunni groups in the region.\u201dIt took all the spin of RT, Assange, Wikileaks and the right-wing side of the press to turn Clinton's attempt to use existing ties to pressure foreign governments to reduce their support for terrorism, into its opposite.I'm sorry but my only conclusion from reading this article is that this woman has a fatally flawed understanding of how the world works. She voted for the opposite of what she wants, because she let herself be bamboozled by the decadent press and Trump's bombastic con-man spiel.Final kicker:> No, I reject Trump\u2019s \u201clocker room\u201d banter, the idea of a \u201cwall\u201d between the United States and Mexico and a plan to \u201cban\u201d Muslims. But I trust the United States and don\u2019t buy the political hyperbole \u2014 agenda-driven identity politics of its own \u2014 that demonized Trump and his supporters.Hannah Arendt, a highly intelligent thinker, on the topic, points out that when politicians are allowed to say one thing and do the opposite, totalitarianism is not far behind.\u000a

VI still dont see why people refer to Trump as some negotiating savant. Time after time,  its been shown that hes notoriously thin skinned and easy to rattle. During the 3rd debate  he was not doing terrible until Hillary commented that he's only successful because daddy gave him money.  Trump's inherent identity and belief that he was responsible for all of his own success being under attack in a public forum caused him to become apoplectic. You could see the anger rise, his face turned beet red, he saw red, wasn't thinking clearly and it was then that he went off the rails and his performance suffered. It was clear he had been rattled and veered far off message.I imagine this is his personality. Whatever the case, it has been a constant since I became aware of him from Howard Stern during his playboy years in the 1980's. New Yorkers are well aware of this, his ego and his compulsive need to settle scores with reporters and others for any perceived slight whether imagined or real when he was a fixture of Page 6. Someone like Putin or anyone else  with a poker face and on even footing could play him like a fiddle, alternating between awe/flattery and hurling passive aggressive insults.\u000a

Risk-adverse entrepreneurs watch from the sidelines, waiting for the right opportunity and balancing their risk portfolios before entering.* Failure rates aof 47%/8% (first movers / settlers)\u000a

VArment is way too positive on the Mac Pro's thermal design. Recently I worked on an application where we had about a dozen Mac Pros doing heavy video encoding workloads. Four of these computers started having GPU overheating issues, and turns out that this is a common occurrence on the 2013 Mac Pro. Apple has been quietly replacing units over the years (searching for the specific console error message reveals that it's common among Mac Pro owners).My theory is that the Mac Pro hasn't seen an update because Apple knows that its current thermal design is a lemon, and they don't really want to sell any more of these because the replacement rate is so high.\u000a

VI'm fascinated by the topic of English Prime: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-PrimeIt introduced me to the idea that 'is' should be treated very carefully. Any assertion outside of strict formal languages that use it are half-truths at best. It also introduces heightens the emotional tone of a discussion. If you say "John is foo" you tend to create the impression that John will always and has always been foo. Foo-ness is a taint on his soul. Contrast that with reformulations that make it explicit that John's foo-ness is a fleeting association related to both his present situation, your current perception of it and the current socially accepted meaning of foo along with all it's implied baggage.I realise I might be rather off-topic :-)\u000a

VIn my experience, 99% of people who talk about the blockchain innovation have absolutely no idea what they're talking about. They also have no idea (or pretend to have no idea) why Bitcoin was invented in the first place: it was invented to avoid the need to ask a permission to send value. That's why a blockchain and proof of work were needed - so people who don't know each other could exchange value on the network safely and without intermediaries. It was not invented to make AML/KYC easier or to make banks richer.One thing this article and many so called experts don't "get" about the blockchain is that it's pretty useless without the currency, namely Bitcoin. There has to be an incentive for lots of decentralized parties to verify (by spending energy) transactions on the blockchain and agree on the history - that incentive is mining currency that has value. If you "invent" your own blockchain, not many people (if any) are going to mine it, making it de-facto less secure than Bitcoin.If you have a number of financial institutions (who already trust each other) that need to process transactions, send documents etc. you don't need a blockchain - you need a database and a messaging system. Blockchain is going to be a less effective and more expensive way to do the same job in this case.Here's a small diagram to help you understand whether you need a blockchain: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Cn2zMbTWYAAQA6i.png\u000a

The aforementioned barrier-separated box is high in entropy but simple. Upon lifting the barrier, a description of the gas front moving into the vacuum is enormously complex. It is also lower in entropy than the previous, barrier-separated state. Finally, when the gas is diffuse and entropy at its maximum, complexity dips back down.Life is complex. Plants turn solar radiation into complex living structures; they also diffuse waste heat. Animals eat those plants, make more complex stuff, and generate more diffuse waste heat.\u000a
